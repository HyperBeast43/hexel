# Hexel


Thanks to:
  - [Hannah Park](https://github.com/hannahcode) for creating the [Wordle clone](https://github.com/hannahcode/wordle) that I modified.
  - The real Wordle [here](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)

# WHAT???!???

In Wordle, you need to guess a 5 letter word. The game lets you know which letters you get right each time you guess a valid word.

In Hexel, it's the exact same, but with 6 letters. Cheers!


_To Run Locally:_
Clone the repository and perform the following command line actions:
```bash
$ cd wordle
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```
